# Movies JSON

## Popular movie lists in json format

The main purpose of this repo is to have some ready to go json data to use when writing 
front end development projects or scripting exercises in Ruby or Python. And I also really 
enjoy watching movies, so I decided to base my examples on some popular film series.

My current lists include these awesome film series:

* Fast and the Furious
* Harry Potter
* Lord of the Rings
* Marvel Cinematic Universe
* Star Wars

... more to come.
