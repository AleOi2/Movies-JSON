## Movies JSON

### Popular movie lists in json format

The main purpose of this repo is to have some ready to go json data to use when writing 
front end development projects using Angular, Ember, Backbone or other MVC/* frameworks and libraries. Because I enjoy watching movies, I decided to base the lists on some popular film series.

My current JSON files include these film series:

* Awesome Martial Arts Cinema
* Awesome Science Fiction
* Fast and the Furious
* Harry Potter
* Lord of the Rings
* Marvel Cinematic Universe
* Star Wars

**Sample JSON data format:**

	"Lord of the Rings" : {
      "The Fellowship of the Ring": {
        "movie_id" : 1,
        "title" : "The Fellowship of the Ring",
        "source" : "Lord of the Rings",
        "classification" : "Middle Earth",
        "order" : 1,
        "category_name" : "Fantasy",
        "release_year" : 2001,
        "running_time" : 178,
        "rating_name" : "PG-13",
        "disc_format_name" : "Blu-ray",
        "number_discs" : 2,
