# Movies JSON

## Popular movie lists in json format

The main purpose of this repo is to have some ready to go json data to use when writing 
front end development projects using Angular, Backbone, Knockout or other MVC/* frameworks and libraries. And 
I also really enjoy watching movies, so I decided to base my examples on some popular film series.

My current lists include these awesome film series:

* Fast and the Furious
* Harry Potter
* Lord of the Rings
* Marvel Cinematic Universe
* Star Wars

Recently Added:

* Awesome Martial Arts Cinema
* Awesome Science Fiction
